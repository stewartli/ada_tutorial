Accounting professionals tend to work under pressure so that they can cover as much ground as possible. However, tools at their disposal often have very limited power and are unable to optimistically fit their workflow. Furthermore, their work is prone to errors due to too many copy+paste and unreproduciblity.

In our view, **R** is a perfect tool to increases their productivity and conform to their workflow. Data analytics lifecycle described by [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) sensibly matchs audit routines. This document is meant to demonstrate the usefulness of R in the field of audit via a specific use case.

**Data cleaning**

<hr>


```{r}
df <- read_csv(here::here('data/billboard_clean.csv'))

head(df, 25) %>%
  mutate(len = round(len, 0)) %>% 
  kable(
    # format.args = list(decimal.mark = '.', big.mark = ","),
    longtable = TRUE,
    booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position", "repeat_header"), font_size = 10) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(c(10,20), bold = FALSE, color = "white", background = "coral") %>%
  footnote(general = "The first 25 rows of data",
           footnote_as_chunk = TRUE,

**Data munging**

<hr>


```{r}

  summarise(best_score = min(rank), 
            best_last = sum(rank == 1)) %>% 
  mutate(peak = ifelse(best_score == 1, 'best hit', 'no hit')) %>% 
  ungroup()

best %>% 
  filter(fct_lump(artist, 5, w = best_last) != 'Other') %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F, font_size = 10) %>% 
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE) %>% 
  collapse_rows(columns = c(1), valign = "top") %>%
